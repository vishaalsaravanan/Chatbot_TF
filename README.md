# Seq2SeQ Model-Based Chatbot implementation in TensorFlow 1.0

A simple chatbot application trained using  Cornell movie dataset for contextually recognizing and replying to the users with some prior knowledge of the referred instance using the basic LSTM based dynamic Recurrent Neural Network Model trained on the given dataset.

**Note**: Unzip the zip file Movielines.zip files before running the model 

**Requirements:**
1. Tensorflow version -1.0.0 <2.0.0(tf version 1 is prefered)
(which you can install using command given below .Also make sure that you have installed pip already) 
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl
2. Python version > 3

**To run the chatbot:**
1. Navigate to the project folder 
2. Open the folder in Control Panel 
3. Run python chatpot.py

Hurray!, Now you can your chatbot program and get yourself entertained talking to your customed build chatbot. Also free to run the above model in your custom datasets with proper data preprocessing applied.
